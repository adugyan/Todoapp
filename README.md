# Todoapp

> Basic MVC flow. From the view the user can insert input, and submit to a post route (/todo/create). That goes to the post request listener on the controller side. The controller will then manipulate our model, and grab the latest model from our database to become the new view.


- version 1.0
> 7/8/2020 
- Included an Ajax fetch method so that input from the user is immediately appended. Page refreshment is no longer needed
